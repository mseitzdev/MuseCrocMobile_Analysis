MU_01_500Hz_NoFilter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sub-folder includes special code versions for using the 
MU_01, aka the original muse from 2014, at 500Hz wiht the two AUX electrodes loaded in. 

Currently, we need to fix one of these devices to use this properly. 

Other models and preset of muse use better built-in signal filtering, but the 
MU_01 does not when operating at 500Hz, and thus more sophisticated data analysis 
is needed.
