**MuseCrocMobile_Analysis**

This is the graphing code to work with the data from MuseCroc Mobile. It is configured to work wth .csv files output from the 
application, and contains complete jupyter notebooks containing examples of loading the data into MNE, applying filters, 
graphing with matplotlib, and more. 

This code is rough, but functional. 

MNE_test -> This file provides examples of how to load the .csv files into MNE as a raw data object and graph. 

muse_csv -> This file provides examples of graphing the data from the .csv file in matplotlib, as well as 
            application if basic filtering. 

500Hz_nofilter -> This folder contains modified examples intended to work with 500Hz presets on the Original Muse 
                  from 2014. 

Currently, there is one example file included, which is a test file of myself staring at the screen for 30 seconds. 
Use this or create your own .csv recording using MuseCrocMobile and experiment a little!
